# This file enables modules to be automatically managed by the Functions service.
# See https://aka.ms/functionsmanageddependency for additional information.
#
# LinkTome bundles all modules locally in the Modules folder and imports them explicitly.
# managedDependency is disabled in host.json - this file is intentionally empty.
